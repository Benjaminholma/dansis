Frederik L. Zafiryadis wins this year's DANSIS graduate award for his thesis "Numerical modeling of droplet trajectories in pilot plant spray dryer fitted with rotary atomizer".

Again this year we had many very qualified contributions for the graduate award. The winner of 2019 did an extensive study combining both numerical simulations and experiments of the complex phenomena occuring in a pilot spray dryer. We congratulate Frederik with the award and thank all the candidates who have sent in their thesis for consideration for the award.
