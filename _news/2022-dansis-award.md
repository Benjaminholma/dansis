Rasmus Byrdal Kj√¶r wins this year's DANSIS graduate award for his thesis "Experimental and CFD Analysis of Roll Damping of Installation Vessels".

Again this year we had many very qualified contributions for the graduate award. The winner of 2022 did an extensive study on roll damping combining both numerical simulations and experiments.
We congratulate Rasmus with the award and thank all the candidates who have sent in their thesis for consideration for the award.
