Nicolai Arent Quist and Rasmus Haurum Johansen win this year's DANSIS graduate award for their thesis "Validation of a Full Scale CFD Model of a Self-Propelled Ship with Measured Hull Roughness and Welded Seams".

Again this year we had many very qualified contributions for the graduate award. The winners of 2023 did an extensive study on the effects of hull roughness and welded seams on ship hulls combining both numerical simulations and experiments.
We congratulate Nicolai and Rasmus with the award and thank all the candidates who have sent in their thesis for consideration for the award.
