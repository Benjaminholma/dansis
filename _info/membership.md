teaser: Overview of DANSIS membership options and how to become a member.
---

The main benefit of membership is that member meetings are free of charge. Lunch etc at meetings is often sponsored by different companies and are therefore untaxed. Member meetings are not just an opportunity to keep updated on flow-mechanical issues, but are also a good place to network.

## Personal membership
A personal membership gives free admission to all DANSIS events in a year, after which the membership then must be renewed. The price for a personal membership is 200 DKK per year.

The prize of a company membership is 1500 DKK per year. By becoming a member you support DANSIS as a company which gives us greater opportunities to create interest and opportunities within the discipline.
